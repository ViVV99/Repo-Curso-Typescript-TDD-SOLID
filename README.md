# Repo-Curso-Typescript-TDD-SOLID
This is a repo from a course about TDD, Node, Typescript and SOLID, where I aim to improve my current knowledge abou those topics

# What do I expect when I finish this course
Have a better understanding about SOLID architecture and TDD, so my projects can become more organised and easy to mantain. Having this knowledge will also help me contribute to other repos
